Command line downloader for spotify tracks, playlists, albums and top artists songs.
It works by taking the metadata out of these items using the Spotify API and searching them up on YouTube.
Then, it downloads the result by using `yt-dlp`.
**This technically means that the tracks have a *really* small chance to be incorrect.**

&nbsp;
## Installation
1. After having installed [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with pip, you can install spotify-dlp using the following command:
	```bash
	pip install spotify-dlp
	```

2. Then, you can authenticate your Spotify account by running the following command:
	```bash
	spotify-dlp --auth
	```
	This command will cause the program to print out an URL. Open it in a browser, log in to your Spotify account and allow the app to access your data. The authentication token should be saved automatically and should get used for future commands.

&nbsp;

*If you do not want to authenticate using the browser, you can manually pass your Client ID and Client Secret as arguments every command. You can get these values by logging to [Spotify developer console](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and clicking on "Create an App", and you can pass them using the `-i` and `-s` arguments, respectively.*
