Command line downloader for spotify tracks, playlists, albums and top artists songs.
It works by taking the metadata out of these items using the Spotify API and searching them up on YouTube Music.
Then, it downloads the result by using yt-dlp.


&nbsp;
## Installation
1. After having installed [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with pip, you can install spotify-dlp using the following command:
	```bash
	pip install spotify-dlp
	```

2. Then, login to [Spotify developer console](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and click on "Create an App". Fill in details for name and description.

3. Make a note of Client ID and Client Secret. These values need to be then set to the `SPOTIFY_DLP_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_DLP_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables respectively

	Alternatively, you can also include them in a `.env` file in the working directory, or even directly pass them as arguments.

	You can set environment variables by doing the following:

	Windows (run in cmd as administrator):
	```sh
	setx SPOTIFY_DLP_CLIENT_ID "your_client_id"
	```
	```sh
	setx SPOTIFY_DLP_CLIENT_SECRET "your_client_secret"
	```

	Linux (add to `~/.bashrc`):
	```sh
	export SPOTIFY_DLP_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
	export SPOTIFY_DLP_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
	```

4. You can now use the script by running `spotify-dlp` in the command line.
	Also, ffmpeg is required if you wish to convert the m4a codec to another one using the `-c` argument.
