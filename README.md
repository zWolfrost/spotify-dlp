Command line downloader for spotify tracks, playlists, albums and top artists songs.
It works by taking the metadata out of these items using the Spotify API and searching them up on YouTube.
Then, it downloads the result by using `yt-dlp`.
**This technically means that the tracks have a *really* small chance to be incorrect.**

&nbsp;
## Installation
1. After having installed [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with pip, you can install spotify-dlp using the following command:
	```bash
	pip install spotify-dlp
	```

2. Then, you can authenticate your Spotify account by running this command and following the instructions:
	```bash
	spotify-dlp --auth
	```
	The authentication tokens should get saved automatically and used for future commands.
